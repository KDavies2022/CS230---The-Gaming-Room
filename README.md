# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room, they wanted to expand on their currently existing app ‘Draw it or Lose it’. They wanted to get the app ready to be accessible on multiple platforms.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel like I did particularly well in planning the code out that I got up and running without issues.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The use of a design document was absolutely helpful. The fact it allowed me to essentially map out what I wanted to do, and when as well as having a handy document to reference for class specific stuff was amazing.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably go back and redo most of my original class/design document, probably fill out the sections that weren’t necessary just so I would have a truly completed document.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the needs as a small company getting ready to roll out what I assumed was their first real big project that they hoped would break into the mobile/console/home market without issues. I emphasised the use of Cloud services because with a small game it wouldn’t take a lot of expenditure unlike buying all of the on site equipment to host and run the game out of their own pocket.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached it slowly. I took my time and focused on OOP principles to really help create code that is both conscise, functional and met all the necessary specifications of the client. In the future I would definitely work on increasing my ability to scan code for ways to improve as I go along if the changes are necessary.
